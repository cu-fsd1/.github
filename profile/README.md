### 📁 Recommended Folder Structure (React)

> You can use **Vite** or **Create React App** (as taught in class).

Example (Vite):

```
character-counter/
│
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── CharacterCounter.jsx
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── main.jsx
│   └── styles.css
│
├── index.html
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

---

### 🛠️ Functional Requirements

- Typing inside the textarea should **instantly update** the character count
- Character count must reflect **all characters**, including spaces
- If a max limit is implemented:
  - Show an error/warning when the limit is exceeded
  - (Optional) Prevent typing beyond the limit OR allow typing but highlight overflow
- UI must remain responsive and clean on different screen sizes

---

### ✅ Suggested Logic (Hint)

- Store textarea text in state:
  - `const [text, setText] = useState("")`
- Character count:
  - `text.length`
- Update on typing:
  - `onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}`

---

### 📸 Output Example (Reference)

- Title: **Live Character Counter**
- Textarea
- Below textarea:
  - `Characters: 0`
  - (Optional) `Words: 0`
  - (Optional) `Limit: 200 (remaining: 200)`

---

### 📌 Notes

- Keep code clean and properly indented
- Add comments where necessary
- Ensure your UI updates **without page reload**
- Make sure it works in both desktop and mobile view
